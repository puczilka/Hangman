# Hangman Game

This is a hangman game implemented in Python. 

This game selects a random word from the list of fruits and asks the user to guess characters in that word. If the user guessed a correct character it will be revealed in the word, if the character selected by the user is not in the word, user's number of lives will be reduced by one. The user will lose the game if he selects 5 wrong characters before all characters are revealed.
